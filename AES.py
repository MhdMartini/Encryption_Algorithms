Now I\'m writing this in Notepad, then copying it into the Neocities editor instead of typing it directly in the Neocities editor to avoid crashing. It sucks that my past two attempts are gone now. Those actually got pretty long. Not the longest, but still pretty long. I hope this one won\'t get lost somehow. Anyways, let\'s talk about WAFFLES! I like waffles. Waffles are cool. Waffles is a funny word. There\'s a Teen Titans Go episode called "Waffles" where the word "Waffles" is said a hundred-something times. It\'s pretty annoying. There\'s also a Teen Titans Go episode about Pig Latin. Don\'t know what Pig Latin is? It\'s a language where you take all the consonan\nHello, everyone! This is the LONGEST TEXT EVER!
