WHAT I LEARNED IN THIS PROJECT:

- Encryption Algorithms:
  RSA, AES, One-time Pads, Diffieâ€“Hellman, symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption.
 
- Math concepts:
  Gauss's Generalization of Wilson's Theorem, Euclid's algorithm, congruency and the mod operation. 
  
- Speed maximization:
  Use of lists vs. dictionaries vs. strings for different operations to maximizes speed. Use of Cython to boost the execution time   of the algorithm.
  
- Matplotlib.pyplot bar graphs for LSA security analysis (lsa_analyzer).
