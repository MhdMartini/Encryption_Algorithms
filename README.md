# python
This code is an implementation of the LSA Encryption Algorithm. The challenge in this project was to create a nencryption algorithm which acheives the best balance between security and speed. 

A mathematician friend of mine invented an encryption algorithm and asked me to implement it with python, and maybe develop a phone app down the road. 

The LSA depends on Gauss's Generalization of Wilson's Theorem; the encryption algorithm and the coding algorithm are explained in detail in a separate file. 

***THE LSA ALGORYTHM IS PATENTED, PLEASE DO NOT USE IT FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES***

WHAT I LEARNED IN THIS PROJECT:

- Encryption Algorithms:
  RSA, AES, One-time Pads, Diffieâ€“Hellman, symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption.
 
- Math concepts:
  Gauss's Generalization of Wilson's Theorem, Euclid's algorithm, congruency and the mod operation. 
  
- Speed maximization:
  Use of lists vs. dictionaries vs. strings for different operations to maximizes speed. Use of Cython to boost the execution time   of the algorithm.
  
- Matplotlib.pyplot bar graphs for LSA security analysis (lsa_analyzer).
